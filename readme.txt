/gmail_monitor contains python files for checking a specific gmail inbox. You’ll have to authorize it yourself!

Dependencies:
- Python 2.7
- GMail API for Python (https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/quickstart-python)
- lxml (http://lxml.de/tutorial.html)

It might be interesting to try context.io, which can push (via webhooks). The difficulty there is starting a server on the local machine to receive post requests, so I’ll leave it be for now.
